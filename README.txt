README

Asterisk .NET is a project to allow you to interact with an Asterisk
system using Mono or .NET. 

This repository originated from http://sourceforge.net/projects/asterisk-dotnet/.

The initial commit to this github repo includes the unmodified source as unziped 
(Asterisk .NET version 1.6.3.1) from the archive at the sourceforge project 
site.  The second commit is the addition of 3 files: License.txt; 
License Info.pdf; and this README.txt.

The original zip archive failed to include any license information.  However,
when someone asked on the project forum, the author stated it was "Beerware".
For completeness, the pdf is a copy of the relevent forum post:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/asterisk-dotnet/forums/forum/505991/topic/3637745 
and the License.txt is a copy of the Beerware license.

As the original project was mostly abandoned a few years ago, I intend to revive 
the project and update it to work with the latest incarnations of Asterisk. I am
not the orinal author and this is merely a fork.  I do not seek to claim credit
for the original code.
